Simple stack calculator. 

'python3 calc.py'

All arithmetic operations pop the first two numbers and push the result.

'+ - * /' : What you'd expect.
'='       : Pop the top item from the stack.
'c'       : Clear the stack.
'p'       : Print the stack.

Supports multi-character input. For instance, '1 1 + =' will return 2, and '1 2 + 3 * =' will return 9.
